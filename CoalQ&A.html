        <h1>Coal Q&A</h1>
        <h2>Q1: What’s the connection between coal and electricity? </h2>
        <p>Nearly 50 percent of U.S. electricity comes from coal. Coal-fired power plants burn coal to generate steam, which is used to turn the turbines of an electrical generator. 
          The U.S. has one of the largest coal reserves in the world and burns it at about 600 plants across the nation. Generating electricity from coal is common in the South and in the heartland, but less often used in regions such as the West Coast, where hydroelectricity and natural gas are bigger sources of power.           
          </p>
          <h2>Q2: If coal is so important to electricity generation, why are some people concerned about building new coal-fired power plants? </h2>
          <p>Coal plants emit carbon dioxide, a major ingredient in climate change.
            In recent years, NASA climate scientist James Hansen has advocated a moratorium on building new coal plants until technology is developed to prevent the carbon dioxide from escaping into the atmosphere. 
            Hansen has warned that continuing to release carbon dioxide at current rates – even just for the next 10 years – will create “a different planet – one without sea ice in the Arctic; with worldwide, repeated coastal tragedies associated with storms and a continuously rising sea level.”  
            The proposed American Municipal Power plant in Meigs County would release an estimated 5.5 million tons of carbon dioxide annually, according to CARMA, a nonprofit group. 
            </p>
            <h2>Q3: Why are there so many electricity-generating coal plants near Meigs County? </h2>
            <p>Coal has been a dominant industry for most of the region’s history. The county’s newest mine began producing coal last February.
